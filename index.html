    <h2> - Call for Papers - </h2>
    <p>
        In recent years, we have witnessed the vigorous development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and applications, in terms of sensing capabilities, connectivity performance, and data analysis. However, existing IoT technology is still far apart from the vision of ubiquitous sensing and trillion-node scale deployment, mainly due to the limited communication coverage, expensive deployment cost, and heavy power consumption. Radio frequency (RF) signals serve as the medium and carrier for information encoding and transmission from the digital space to the physical world. The ubiquitous RF signals possess rich information representation capabilities. The rapid advancements in communication technology, signal processing techniques, novel metamaterials, and electronic engineering drive the rapid progress of RF-centric IoT systems. The RF-based sensing and networking, including wireless sensing, backscatter communication, reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS), cross-technology communication, etc., are research hotspots in the field of IoT.
    </p>

    <p>    
        <b>RF computing is a new computing paradigm, which directly utilizes the RF signal as both the information carrier and the computation object within the RF space to achieve signal processing and transformation.</b> For example, the RF computing device can manipulate the RF signal from the properties of amplitude, frequency, phase, propagation direction, and polarization characteristics, to accomplish the information injection, extraction, and modification. Compared with the purely digital computing, the RF computing is well-adapted to the RF signals' analog and continuous physical properties. By omitting or simplifying the frequent analog-to-digital conversion during the information process, the RF computing can significantly reduce power consumption, eliminate computational latency, and enhance computation efficiency. Moreover, the RF computing also expands the design space of IoT systems, making the programmable IoT systems possible.
    </p>
    <p>    
        <b><u>Objectives: </b></u>This workshop focuses on the research opportunities of RF computing in the field of IoT, spanning from foundational theories to RF resource management and comprehensive applications. First, we study the theory of RF computing that integrates digital and analog computations, including modeling the RF computing capability of analog devices, designing methods for edge devices with hybrid analog-digital functionalities, and developing signal processing techniques for hybrid analog-digital systems. Second, we investigate methods for generating and discovering RF resources, and customizing RF signals according to the diverse requirements of various IoT applications. Third, we also explore the fusion mechanism of sensing, transmission, and computation based on RF, unifying IoT functionalities into an RF-centric computing framework to optimize the utilization of spectrum and energy resources.
    </p>

        <b>The goals of our workshop are summarized as follows:</b>

    <h2> - Submission Guidelines - </h2>
    <p>
        Submissions should be previously unpublished and not currently under review by 
        another conference or journal. Authors must adhere to the provided formatting 
        guidelines, using the LaTeX styles found 
        “https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template”, and ensure that 
        papers do not exceed 6 pages in length. It is important to note that ACM uses 9pt 
        fonts in all conference proceedings, and the LaTeX style implicitly defines the font 
        size to be 9pt. The submission system will be open prior to the submission 
        deadline. All submitted papers will be subject to a rigorous double-blind review 
        process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. 
        Consequently, authors' names and affiliations must not appear anywhere in the 
        paper or the PDF file to maintain the integrity of the review process. Accepted 
        papers are required to be presented at the workshop, ensuring a high standard of 
        contribution to the conference proceedings.
        <br> <br>
        We solicit three types of paper submission:
        <ul>
        <li>Technical Papers up to 6 pages (including everything except references), reporting on novel research, to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation; </li>
        <li>Position Papers up to 4 pages (including everything), reporting on new research directions to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation with interactive discussion; </li>
        <li>Demo/Poster Papers up to 2 pages (including everything), to be presented at the workshop as an interactive demonstration or poster respectively. </li>
        </ul>
