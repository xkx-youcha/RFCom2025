    <h2> - Call for Papers - </h2>
    <p>
        The ever-developing Internet of Things (IoT) brings the prosperity of wireless sensing and control applications. In many 
        scenarios, radio frequency (RF) signal is the medium and carrier for the information encoding and transmission from the digital space 
        to the physical world, which possesses a rich capability for information representation. RF computing refers to a new computing 
        paradigm, which directly utilizes the RF signal as both the information carrier and the computation object within the RF space to 
        achieve signal processing and transformation. The IoT devices can directly manipulate the characteristic properties of RF signals, 
        including amplitude, frequency, phase, propagation direction, and polarization, to achieve information injection, extraction, and 
        modification. This workshop focuses on the research of RF computing for IoT systems, including fundamental theories modeling, RF 
        resource management, and comprehensive applications. We further hope to integrate sensing, transmission, and computing into an RF
        centric computing system, thereby optimizing the spectrum, energy, delay, and computation resources for IoT systems. 
    </p>

    <h2> - Submission Guidelines - </h2>
    <p>
        The accepted papers will be published as part of the conference proceedings and will appear in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions should be previously unpublished and not currently under review by another conference or journal. Authors must adhere to the provided formatting guidelines, using the LaTeX styles found <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>, and ensure that papers do not exceed 6 pages in length. It is important to note that ACM uses 9pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the LaTeX style implicitly defines the font size to be 9pt. The submission system will be open prior to the submission deadline. All submitted papers will be subject to a rigorous double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. Consequently, authors' names and affiliations must not appear anywhere in the paper or the PDF file to maintain the integrity of the review process. Accepted papers are required to be presented at the workshop, ensuring a high standard of contribution to the conference proceedings.
        <br> <br>
        We solicit three types of paper submission:
        <ul>
        <li>Technical Papers up to 6 pages (including everything except references), reporting on novel research, to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation; </li>
        <li>Position Papers up to 4 pages (including everything), reporting on new research directions to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation with interactive discussion; </li>
        <li>Demo/Poster Papers up to 2 pages (including everything), to be presented at the workshop as an interactive demonstration or poster respectively. </li>
        </ul>
